# micro-scrabble
Flask web app for playing scrabble with the Raspberry Pi

## TODOs:

- [ ] Scoring: how to handle letter and word multipliers, multiple directions
- [ ] Better position selection
- [ ] Row and column labels on board
- [ ] Rules for turns: playing a word uses a turn, swapping a letter uses a turn
- [ ] Ability to remove letters from board
- [ ] Position checking on board: cannot overlap, have to be connected to existing word
- [ ] User login
- [ ] Error handling
